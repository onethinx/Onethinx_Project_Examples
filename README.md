# Onethinx_Project_Examples
This folder contains several project examples for use with the Onethinx LoRa(WAN) module.

These projects combine the Visual Code setup for code editing with the magnificent PSoC Creator Schematic Editor & Design Wide Resources Editor for chip setup.

## Preparation
1. Download and install [PSoC Creator](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/psoc-software/psoc-creator/) (optionally)
    - Unfortunately PSoC Creator is Windows only. PSoC Creator is used for chip configuration only and isn't needed for writing and debugging code.
    - The projects in this folder are pre-configured and don't need PSoC Creator to run.
1. Download and install the [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com) 
1. Follow the instructions in the link to install the Onethinx Dependencies Pack:
    - For Windows: [VSCode_OnethinxPack_Windows](https://github.com/onethinx/VSCode_OnethinxPack_Windows)
    - For Linux: [VSCode_OnethinxPack_Linux](https://github.com/onethinx/VSCode_OnethinxPack_Linux)
    - For MacOS: [VSCode_OnethinxPack_MacOS](https://github.com/onethinx/VSCode_OnethinxPack_MacOS)
1. Clone `https://github.com/onethinx/Onethinx_Project_Examples.git` or [download](https://github.com/onethinx/Onethinx_Project_Examples/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unpack the Example Projects to your local machine.
## Configure the Chip Setup (IOs, peripherals etc.) using PSoC Creator
  This step is only needed when you need to change the chip configuration.
1. Start PSoC Creator
1. Open the Onethinx_Creator.cywrk workspace (File >> Open >> Project/Workspace)
1. The PSoC Schematic Editor and the Design Wide Resources can be accessed at the left 'Workspace Explorer' pane:
<br>`..Onethinx_Project_Examples\Example_X\Onethinx_Creator.cydsn\Onethinx_Creator.cywrk`<br><br>
![PSoC_Creator_Config](https://github.com/onethinx/Readme_assets/blob/main/PSoC_Creator_Config.png)
1. After the changes to the chip configuration are done, build the Onethinx Creator project (Build >> Build Onethinx_Creator or Shift + F5)
1. Make sure the project builds well from the output tab and the Onethinx CoreStripper has run:<br>
![Onethinx CoreStripper](https://github.com/onethinx/Readme_assets/blob/main/PSoC_Creator_Build.png)
1. The chip configuration is done and PSoC Creator may be closed.
## Prepare the project in VS Code
1. Start VS Code
1. Load the project by selecting the project folder (File >> Open Folder):
<br>`..\Onethinx_Project_Examples\Example_HelloWorld`<br>
1. If your project has LoRaWAN keys:
    - Navigate to source/OnethinxCore/LoRaWAN_keys.h and fill in your LoRaWAN keys.
1. The following buttons in the statusbar can be used to configure, build and debug the project.
![VScode Buttons](https://github.com/onethinx/Readme_assets/blob/main/VScode_buttons.png)<br>
1. On first-time load of a project, the CMake kit may be uninitialized. Select the correct kit GCC arm-none-eabi from the list.
    - If the GCC compiler in the VSCode_OnethinxPack folder isn't listed, it is adviced to clear the user-local CMake kits file and do a fresh scan:
    View >> Command Pallette >> type 'kits' >> Edit User-Local CMake Kits
    Delete file contents and save
    View >> Command Pallette >> type 'kits' >> Scan for Kits
1. Click `Clean-Reconfigure` in the status bar to configure the project's makefiles (only needs to be done once, when the Chip Configuration is changed and when source files are removed/added to the project).
1. Select the debug adapter to use for the project:
    - From the left extensions pane, click the `Run and Debug` icon (Cortex-Debug extension) and select the debugger for the project from the top 'Run and Debug' dropdown list)
## Build and Debug your code
1. Click `Build` in the status bar to build the project.
1. Click `Build-and-Launch` in the status bar to build and debug the project.
